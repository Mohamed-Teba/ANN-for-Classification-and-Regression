# 🧠 ANN for Classification and Regression 📊

Welcome to the **ANN for Classification and Regression** project! 🚀 This project leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to tackle both classification and regression tasks, enabling accurate predictions for a variety of datasets. From categorizing data to predicting numerical outcomes, this system showcases the power of deep learning. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Artificial Neural Networks are versatile models capable of solving complex problems in classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., house price prediction). This project builds and trains ANNs using Python and deep learning frameworks to address both tasks. It complements the author's previous work, such as the Image Classification Using CNN, by exploring feedforward neural networks for general-purpose prediction. 🧮
